# Simulated Parcel Compute environment

This directory emulates the `/parcel` directory that Parcel will set up and
populate with input datasets. It is intended for quick local testing and
iteration, without the involvement of Parcel.

See the _Complex Compute Jobs_ Parcel tutorial on for more info on using
Docker images with Parcel.
